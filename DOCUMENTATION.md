### Language Files

The plugin supports multiple languages through individual language files located in `plugins/EnhancedCompass/lang/`.

#### English (`en.yml`)

```yaml
messages:
  no_compass: "&cYou need to be holding a compass to use this command."
  player_not_found: "&cPlayer '{player}' not found or offline."
  # ... (full English translations)
```

#### Portuguese Brazil (`pt_br.yml`)

```yaml
messages:
  no_compass: "&cVocÃª precisa estar segurando uma bÃºssola para usar este comando."
  player_not_found: "&cJogador '{player}' nÃ£o encontrado ou offline."
  # ... (full Portuguese translations)
```

## Group System

The group system allows you to set different location limits for different types of players.

### Setting Up Groups

1. **Configure limits** in `config.yml`:

```yaml
groups:
  default: 3
  vip: 10
  premium: 25
  staff: 100
```

2. **Assign permissions** to players or groups:

```
/lp user Steve permission set enhancedcompass.group.vip
/lp group VIP permission set enhancedcompass.group.vip
```

### Group Priority

If a player has multiple group permissions, the plugin uses the **highest** limit available. For example:

- Player has `enhancedcompass.group.default` (3 locations) and `enhancedcompass.group.vip` (10 locations)
- The plugin will allow 10 locations (VIP limit)

### Special Groups

- **Unlimited**: Use permission `enhancedcompass.unlimited` to bypass all limits
- **Custom groups**: Add any group name to the config with a custom limit

## Multi-Language Support

### Available Languages

- **English** (`en`)
- **Portuguese Brazil** (`pt_br`)
- **Spanish** (`es`) - Coming soon
- **French** (`fr`) - Coming soon
- **German** (`de`) - Coming soon

### Changing Language

1. Edit `language` setting in `config.yml`
2. Run `/compass reload` or restart the server

### Custom Messages

You can override specific messages in `config.yml` under the `messages` section without changing the language file.

### Color Codes

Use Minecraft color codes with `&`:

| Code | Color       | Code | Color        |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------------ |
| `&0` | Black       | `&8` | Dark Gray    |
| `&1` | Dark Blue   | `&9` | Blue         |
| `&2` | Dark Green  | `&a` | Green        |
| `&3` | Dark Aqua   | `&b` | Aqua         |
| `&4` | Dark Red    | `&c` | Red          |
| `&5` | Dark Purple | `&d` | Light Purple |
| `&6` | Gold        | `&e` | Yellow       |
| `&7` | Gray        | `&f` | White        |

### Player Location Files

Each player's locations are stored in individual YAML files named by their UUID:

```yaml
# player-locations/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.yml
locations:
  home:
    world: world
    x: 100.5
    y: 64.0
    z: 200.7
  shop:
    world: world
    x: -50.0
    y: 70.0
    z: 150.2
```

### Global Locations File

```yaml
# global-locations.yml
locations:
  spawn:
    world: world
    x: 0.0
    y: 64.0
    z: 0.0
  pvp:
    world: world_pvp
    x: 100.0
    y: 80.0
    z: -200.0
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Navigation

```bash
# Point to a player
/compass Steve
/compass NotchFan123

# Point to saved locations
/compass home
/compass shop
/compass base

# Point to coordinates
/compass 0 64 0
/compass 1000 100 -500
```

### Managing Locations

```bash
# Save your current location
/compass set home
/compass set shop
/compass set secret_base

# Save global locations (admin only)
/compass set global spawn
/compass set global pvp_arena

# List all your locations
/compass list

# Delete a location
/compass delete old_base
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Reset compass to world spawn
/compass reset

# Admin: List another player's locations
/compass admin list Steve

# Admin: Delete another player's location
/compass admin delete Steve old_house

# Reload configuration
/compass reload
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "You need to be holding a compass"

**Cause**: Player is not holding a compass in their main hand.

**Solutions**:

- Hold a compass in your main hand
- Ask an admin to give you the `enhancedcompass.bypass.compass` permission
- Admin can set `require_compass: false` in config.yml

#### "Player not found or offline"

**Cause**: Target player is not online or name is misspelled.

**Solutions**:

- Check the player's name spelling
- Ensure the target player is online
- Use tab completion to auto-complete player names

#### "Location not found"

**Cause**: Trying to navigate to a location that doesn't exist.

**Solutions**:

- Use `/compass list` to see available locations
- Check spelling of location name
- Verify if it's a personal or global location

#### "The target is not in the same world"

**Cause**: Trying to point compass to a target in a different world.

**Solutions**:

- Travel to the same world as your target
- Ask an admin for `enhancedcompass.bypass.world` permission
- Admin can enable `allow_cross_world: true` in config

#### "You have reached your location limit"

**Cause**: Player has hit their group's location limit.

**Solutions**:

- Delete unused locations with `/compass delete <name>`
- Ask an admin for a higher group permission
- Admin can increase group limits in config.yml

### Performance Issues

#### High memory usage

- Reduce `auto_save_interval` or set to 0
- Clean up unused player location files
- Consider using a database storage plugin

#### Slow commands

- Check for plugin conflicts
- Verify server TPS is stable
- Update to the latest plugin version

### Configuration Issues

#### Changes not taking effect

- Run `/compass reload` after editing config files
- Check YAML syntax is valid
- Restart server if reload doesn't work

#### Language not changing

- Verify language file exists in `lang/` folder
- Check `language` setting in config.yml
- Ensure file encoding is UTF-8

## API Reference

### For Developers

EnhancedCompass provides a simple API for other plugins to interact with location data.

#### Getting the API

```java
import br.com.fuzalabs.enhancedcompass.api.EnhancedCompassAPI;

// Get API instance
EnhancedCompassAPI api = EnhancedCompassAPI.getInstance();
```

#### Basic Methods

```java
// Check if player has a location
boolean hasLocation = api.hasLocation(player.getUniqueId(), "home");

// Get player's location
Location location = api.getLocation(player.getUniqueId(), "home");

// Save a location for player
api.saveLocation(player.getUniqueId(), "home", player.getLocation());

// Delete a location
api.deleteLocation(player.getUniqueId(), "home");

// Get all locations for player
Map<String, Location> locations = api.getPlayerLocations(player.getUniqueId());

// Point player's compass to location
api.pointCompass(player, location);
```

#### Events

```java
import br.com.fuzalabs.enhancedcompass.events.*;

@EventHandler
public void onLocationSave(LocationSaveEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    String locationName = event.getLocationName();
    Location location = event.getLocation();

    // Your code here
}

@EventHandler
public void onCompassPoint(CompassPointEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    Location target = event.getTarget();

    // Your code here
