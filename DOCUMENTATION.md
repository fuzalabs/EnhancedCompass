## Permissions

### Basic Permissions

| Permission              | Description                       | Default |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------- |
| `enhancedcompass.use`   | Access to basic compass commands  | `true`  |
| `enhancedcompass.admin` | Access to administrative commands | `op`    |

### Group Permissions

Location limits are controlled by group permissions. Players receive the highest limit from their assigned groups.

| Permission                      | Description                     | Default Limit |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `enhancedcompass.group.default` | Default group with basic limits | 3 locations   |

## Configuration

### Main Configuration (`config.yml`)

```yaml
# Language configuration
# Available languages: en, pt_br
# Default: en (English)
language: en

# Groups configuration
# Define groups and their location limits
# Example:
# groups:
#   default: 3
#   vip: 10
#   staff: 100
groups:
  default: 3
```

**Configuration Options:**

- **`language`**: Sets the default language for messages. Currently supports `en` (English) and `pt_br` (Portuguese Brazil)
- **`groups`**: Defines permission groups and their location limits. Players with higher group permissions can save more locations

### Language Files

The plugin supports multiple languages through individual language files located in `plugins/EnhancedCompass/lang/`.

#### English (`en.yml`)

```yaml
messages:
  no_compass: "&cYou need to be holding a compass to use this command."
  player_not_found: "&cPlayer '{player}' not found or offline."
  # ... (full English translations)
```

#### Portuguese Brazil (`pt_br.yml`)

```yaml
messages:
  no_compass: "&cVocÃª precisa estar segurando uma bÃºssola para usar este comando."
  player_not_found: "&cJogador '{player}' nÃ£o encontrado ou offline."
  # ... (full Portuguese translations)
```

## Group System

The group system allows you to set different location limits for different types of players.

### Setting Up Groups

1. **Configure limits** in `config.yml`:

```yaml
groups:
  default: 3
  vip: 10
  premium: 25
  staff: 100
```

2. **Assign permissions** to players or groups:

```
/lp user Steve permission set enhancedcompass.group.vip
/lp group VIP permission set enhancedcompass.group.vip
```

### Group Priority

If a player has multiple group permissions, the plugin uses the **highest** limit available. For example:

- Player has `enhancedcompass.group.default` (3 locations) and `enhancedcompass.group.vip` (10 locations)
- The plugin will allow 10 locations (VIP limit)

### Special Groups

- **Unlimited**: Use permission `enhancedcompass.unlimited` to bypass all limits
- **Custom groups**: Add any group name to the config with a custom limit

## Multi-Language Support

### Available Languages

- **English** (`en`)
- **Portuguese Brazil** (`pt_br`)

### Changing Language

1. Edit `language` setting in `config.yml`
2. Run `/compassadmin reload` or restart the server

### Custom Messages

Language messages are controlled by the individual language files (`en.yml`, `pt_br.yml`) in the `lang/` directory. You can edit these files directly to customize messages, but changes will be overwritten when the plugin is updated.

### Color Codes

Use Minecraft color codes with `&`:

| Code | Color       | Code | Color        |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------------ |
| `&0` | Black       | `&8` | Dark Gray    |
| `&1` | Dark Blue   | `&9` | Blue         |
| `&2` | Dark Green  | `&a` | Green        |
| `&3` | Dark Aqua   | `&b` | Aqua         |
| `&4` | Dark Red    | `&c` | Red          |
| `&5` | Dark Purple | `&d` | Light Purple |
| `&6` | Gold        | `&e` | Yellow       |
| `&7` | Gray        | `&f` | White        |

#### Format Codes

- `&l` - Bold
- `&o` - Italic
- `&n` - Underlined
- `&m` - Strikethrough
- `&k` - Obfuscated
- `&r` - Reset

### Player Location Files

Each player's locations are stored in individual YAML files named by their UUID:

```yaml
# player-locations/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.yml
locations:
  home:
    world: world
    x: 100.5
    y: 64.0
    z: 200.7
  shop:
    world: world
    x: -50.0
    y: 70.0
    z: 150.2
```

### Global Locations File

```yaml
# global-locations.yml
locations:
  spawn:
    world: world
    x: 0.0
    y: 64.0
    z: 0.0
  pvp:
    world: world_pvp
    x: 100.0
    y: 80.0
    z: -200.0
```

## Usage Examples

```

### Advanced Usage

/compass reset

# Admin: Reload configuration
/compassadmin reload

# Admin: Show plugin information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "You need to be holding a compass"

**Cause**: Player is not holding a compass in their main hand.

**Solutions**:

- Hold a compass in your main hand
- This requirement is currently hardcoded and cannot be bypassed

#### "Player not found or offline"

**Cause**: Target player is not online or name is misspelled.

**Solutions**:

- Check the player's name spelling
- Ensure the target player is online
- Use tab completion to auto-complete player names

#### "Location not found"

**Cause**: Trying to navigate to a location that doesn't exist.

**Solutions**:

- Check spelling of location name (names are case-insensitive)
- Verify if it's a personal or global location
- Make sure you've saved the location first with `/compass set <name>`

#### "The target is not in the same world"

**Cause**: Trying to point compass to a target in a different world.

**Solutions**:

- Travel to the same world as your target
- Cross-world compass pointing is currently not supported

#### "You have reached your location limit"

**Cause**: Player has hit their group's location limit.

**Solutions**:

- Currently no way to delete locations (feature not yet implemented)
- Ask an admin for a higher group permission
- Admin can increase group limits in config.yml

### Performance Issues

#### High memory usage

- Clean up unused player location files in `player-locations/` directory
- Consider regular maintenance of location files

#### Slow commands

- Check for plugin conflicts
- Verify server TPS is stable
- Update to the latest plugin version

### Configuration Issues

#### Changes not taking effect

- Run `/compassadmin reload` after editing config files
- Check YAML syntax is valid
- Restart server if reload doesn't work

#### Language not changing

- Verify language file exists in `lang/` folder
- Check `language` setting in config.yml
- Ensure file encoding is UTF-8
